## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git and GitHub because it is essential for my course where I can upload my activities and projects. In addition, it is widely used globally and locally, where there is an opportunity to collaborate and learn from other developers aside from classmates and instructors. My works or projects will also be useful for my future endeavors that will serve as my back-up identity if I will pursue this field.
