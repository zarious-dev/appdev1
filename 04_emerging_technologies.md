# Emerging Technology: 5G Technology

## Purpose
5G wireless technology is meant to deliver higher multi-Gbps peak data speeds, ultra low latency, more reliability, massive network capacity, increased availability, and a more uniform user experience to more users. Higher performance and improved efficiency empower new user experiences and connects new industries. In addition, 5G mobile networks are an opportunity for manufacturers to create hyper-connected smart factories. 5G supports the Internet of Things, meaning factories can wirelessly connect several thousands of smart devices like cameras and sensors to automatically collect data in real-time.
